\section{INTRODUCTION}


With the rising land wrangles and theft cases of land in the country there is an urgent need for a solution to remedy the situation 
\section{BACKGROUND} 
As a country Uganda faces a large challenge of a corrupt infrastructure that is to say the institution that governs some of her resources. Case in point there is an increase in cases of government or public servant officials being involved in shady land acquisitions. Hence the need for an urgent solution to this problem. 
\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT} 
The problem that is research is to address is the land theft with in Uganda. Land theft has been aided by duplication of land documents and forging or unclear land ownership deals. The research is to find a suitable and effective way in which to employ the use of block-chain technology as a solution to the problem. 
\section{OBJECTIVE} 
To use block-chain technology in order to prevent duplication of documents such as land titles in turn reducing on cases of land theft 

\section{METHODOLOGY}
There will collection of data relating on how land transference, ownership and processing is done.
Creation of a large database of all issued land titles stored as record, each land title will have a unique identifier which will insure that there is only and only one instance of a given land title in the system
 Creation of a block-chain network having linked and secured records.

\section{OUTCOMES} 
Prevention of duplicating of land titles since there is only one instance of a land title record as an entity in the system.
Parties involved in any land deals will be able to keep track of their documents since any access to the system as regards to any record will be logged.
